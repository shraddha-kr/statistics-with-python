    "\n",
    "**Sampling techniques** or methods deal with collecting data in the real world as it exists, namely through opinion\n",
    "polls, cross-sectional studies, surveys dealing with political and social issues, etc. \n",
    "Sampling is an essential part of everyday life and we return to it in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "The object of **Design of Experiments**, on the other hand is to design data collection in a more controlled\n",
    "setting in order to answer specific scientific questions, as in agricultural or clinical trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in either case is to maximize the “information” obtained for a given amount of money\n",
    "or conversely, to minimize the cost for attaining a given level of precision. Averages tend to have higher precision, a fact we will learn soon. Thus, designing a proper experiment\n",
    "is very crucial and different methods of collecting information can be quite different in terms of their efficiency."

    "### Population, sample and inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often the data statisticians collect is a sample, i.e., a **randomly selected (and hence\n",
    "representative) subset of the population**. We use the word population to refer to the\n",
    "“entirety of data one can collect on a topic of interest”. For instance, \n",
    "\n",
    "if one is interested in the “average family income” in the US, the population here consists of incomes of every\n",
    "family in the US – over 100 million numbers (after one tackles such non-trivial questions as\n",
    "to what we mean by a “family” and what we mean by “family income” etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If suppose we are interested in “television rating” for a particular TV show in a given week, the word\n",
    "population then refers to all the data on time spent by each of the potential viewers watching\n",
    "this show. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a third example, consider the situation where one is interested in figuring out\n",
    "the “chance of heads” for a given coin. The entirety of data here refers to the results of all\n",
    "possible tosses with this coin. Since the coin can be flipped forever to obtain more and more\n",
    "data about this coin, the population is theoretically infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In all these cases, a sensible thing to do is to take a representative sample from such a\n",
    "population and try to interpret what this sample has to say, regarding the population.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of generalizations i.e., drawing conclusions about the population from the observed\n",
    "sample, is called **“statistical inference”.** Statistical inference is a fundamental ingredient in\n",
    "most scientific advances because we can not wait in most cases for “all the data to be in”. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In some cases, it is patently unwise or impossible to collect all the data - like in the coin-tossing\n",
    "example.**\n",
    "Think what would happen if a manufacturer wanted to determine the “lifetime”\n",
    "of a certain brand of electric bulb and started to burn each of the bulbs manufactured in\n",
    "order to get the “totality of data” on the lifetimes. Not good for business since there would\n",
    "be nothing left to sell!\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, **we call a “properly” selected subset of population, a sample , whose representativeness\n",
    "is guaranteed by selecting the sample units randomly.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, we select a\n",
    "simple random sample of size n by giving each unit in the population **the same chance of**\n",
    "being selected into the sample and also by giving every sample of size n from this population\n",
    "the same chance of being selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of random sampling include:\n",
    "i) reduced cost,\n",
    "ii) possibility to measure precision in the sample estimates,\n",
    "iii) greater accuracy and scope are possible, as opposed to a complete population count,\n",
    "iv) sometimes, sampling is the only way, as when the population is infinite (e.g., coin tossing)\n",
    "or when measurements involve destructive testing (as when studying the life-times of light\n",
    "bulbs).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is known in advance that the characteristic under study is heterogeneous\n",
    "among the **various subgroups** of the population. For instance, in an agricultural experiment\n",
    "say comparing the yields of different varieties of wheat, we may know that certain plots of\n",
    "land are more fertile than others and will give higher yields. Or in an electoral poll, we\n",
    "may know that Blacks, Hispanics and Caucasians tend to vote quite differently. In such\n",
    "cases, it is best to separate out the population into these subgroups, called **“blocks”** in an\n",
    "experimental design context or **“strata”** in a sampling context and then randomly select a\n",
    "proportionate number of units from each subgroup. This idea termed blocking avoids the\n",
    "possibility of all fertile plots of land being assigned to a particular variety of wheat or of our\n",
    "poll sample being entirely Caucasian and thus ensures the representativeness of the overall\n",
    "sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The choice of blocks or strata should be such that all the units within a block are\n",
    "as homogeneous as possible and there is considerable difference between blocks.** \n",
    "A simple example of such blocking occurs later in Section 9.1, in what is referred to as paired data.\n",
